### Course Description: 
This course is divided in two parts. The first part consists of general understanding of the concepts on computer science,understanding github and various other tools required for coding. The second part is where the "programming" bit comes in. Once you have understood the concepts of computer science, we will learn how to apply them using an object oriented programming language (in our case C++).

### Course Schedule:
We have a whole lot of things to cover in a short period of time. In an ideal world  we would be able to achieve our set target. That being said, the schedule is subject to change and the class should be notified well in advance if there are any changes.
