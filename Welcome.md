Hello World! </br >

I understand that this wasn't the easiest summer for everyone of us. But, I hope you are excited to get back to school. My name is Shreyas Rane, and I am teaching the Intro to Comp Sci course this fall. Our first class is on Wednesday, September 16, and there are some things I would like all of you do prior to then.

First and foremost, I need everyone to create an account at www.github.com. If you already have an account you are absolutely free to use that account, no need to make a new one. Once you create the account, please email (srane@taftschool.org) me your GitHub username. Once I have that I will invite you to our course portal (we would Github as the main portal and powerschool will be used for grading and redirection links). You will need to make an account as assignments, notes, and all course material will be provided via GitHub. If Github sounds new to you, then you do not have to worry. We will learn about Git during the semester.
We will be working within a Linux environment the entire semester (again, don't worry). You would need to set up a virtual machine and Linux on it. How to do that? Here are the steps:
Installing Virtual Box- </br >
MAC: https://www.osstuff.com/how-to-install-virtualbox-on-mac/ </br >
Windows: https://www.how2shout.com/how-to/install-virtualbox-step-by-step-windows-10-7.html</br >

Setup Ubuntu (a Linux distro)- </br >

If you are facing any problems with the installation, please get in touch with me immediately! </br>

All of this information is to help our first class go a little smoother; there is a lot of setup and preparation to do, so the more you can do ahead of time the quicker we can jump into the material. Please let me know if you have any questions at all.

Looking forward to seeing everyone! </br>

Shreyas
